The project involves building a machine learning model to analyze and predict forex trading patterns. Using various data sources, including financial indicators and currency pairs, the project focuses on optimizing trading strategies by training models like Logistic Regression. The data is processed and visualized using libraries like Pandas, Plotly, and Altair, with optimization handled by Optuna. The goal is to improve trading precision by selecting the best hyperparameters through iterative testing and validation. The project leverages Python's data science stack to enhance forex trading decisions.
